## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
The Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence, carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotions to the next higher grade for scientific manpower within DRDO. Conducting interviews is a complex task requiring a structured and unbiased assessment to identify the right talent. The interview process involves posing a set of relevant questions by an interviewer and evaluating responses from candidates, ensuring that both questions and answers align with the applicant's area of expertise. The proposed solution should provide both experts and candidates with a real-life boardroom experience, beginning with initial ice-breaking questions and progressing to in-depth techno-managerial questions, depending on the candidate's level. Additionally, it should offer a quantifiable scoring system for both experts and candidates, evaluating the relevancy of questions with respect to the applicant's expertise. Similarly, candidate responses should be graded for relevance to the question asked, ultimately leading to an overall subject knowledge score and determining the candidate’s suitability for the advertised position.

To address these challenges, an AI-powered interview assessment system can be developed to provide an efficient, structured, and unbiased evaluation process. The system will leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to generate relevant questions dynamically based on the candidate’s expertise and responses. It will incorporate automated scoring mechanisms that assess the relevancy of questions posed by experts and evaluate the candidate’s responses against predefined knowledge criteria. The system will adapt its questioning approach, starting with general ice-breaking inquiries and progressively transitioning into in-depth technical and managerial topics. Additionally, the AI model will provide real-time feedback and scoring, allowing experts to refine their assessment while ensuring a fair evaluation process. The system will also generate detailed performance reports with visual analytics, providing a data-driven approach for RAC to make informed hiring and promotion decisions. By implementing this intelligent interview system, RAC can enhance efficiency, minimize biases, and ensure the identification of the most suitable candidates for scientific roles within DRDO.
